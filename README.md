# booking-system-with-GAS
A simple booking system using GAS(Google Apps Script) + Google Calendar + Google Forms  
This repo is for test. Actual one is used on my personal business; private English lesson.

# How it works
1. Fill out the form to book a lesson and submit the form
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfriSnbloSMSqU7I6WQdUvET_OjIW2tzf3EdERz5yKlPSVjBw/viewform

2. Once submitting the form, the data that are input will be stored on Google SpreadSheet
  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19ZpQoqTgpS2I51isrtHZTLChTb4sgM_sbwrhcOMl3s4  
  (** email address column is hidden since it's personal infomation)
  
3. what GAS does
  - creating on your google calendar and my(yuki.nagano.hb@gmail.com) calendar
  - the submitter will receive an invitation email that it's input on the form

**Now, booking is done!**  
  
To check the event that you submitted:  
Check [my calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?height=600&amp;wkst=1&amp;bgcolor=%23ffffff&amp;ctz=Asia%2FTokyo&amp;src=azNwNmpoNTBzaDZwY3YwNXNna2hpMjZ0OHNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ&amp;color=%23D81B60&amp;hl=en&amp;mode=MONTH") or [your own calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r)!

# For people who would like to test this form 
**PLEASE INPUT A VALID EMAIL!**   
If you put an invalid email, I will receive lots of error logs from GAS :(  
Thanks for your corporation.
